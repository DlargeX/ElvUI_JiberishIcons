# Jiberish Icons
Requires ElvUI

Thanks to Repooc from ElvUI on creating this AddOn! Be sure to check out all of Repooc's addons & join his discord: https://repoocreforged.dev/discord

Custom Icon Pack with Unique Class Colored Icons for each class!

The addon pack will add a Tag in ElvUI > Available Tags > Jiberish that you can then copy/paste into a Custom Text Field in ElvUI > Unit Frames!

There's also a file path that you can use for Details: Details Options -> Bars: General -> Custom Texture File -> Interface\AddOns\ElvUI_JiberishIcons\Media\Icons\fabled or Interface\AddOns\ElvUI_JiberishIcons\Media\Icons\fabledrealm

You can also adjust the tag size by adding:[jiberish:icon:fabledrealm{32}] or [jiberish:icon:fabled{32}]
